# All Your Actions Are Belong To Us

This is a text adventure written for the 0h game jam.  It was done in approximately five 
hours, not zero, and I think I submitted it when it was time for the Hawaii entries to 
be turned in.  It was based on an idea I found on 
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/indiebuskers/comments/11wfmo/pointnclick_adventure_game_with_onetimeuse)
which I really wanted to see turned in to a game.

# Is it done?

No.

# Is it playable?

I think so?  It's a text adventure, and I can't remember if the story is properly glued
together quite right, but it's about 90% done and I think I do need to clean up some loose
threads.

Haven given it another play-through, no, it is completely not done and will require some
clean up.  The ideas are in there, though.

# The source for this looks funny, how do I use it?

You will find a [playable version](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59395735/AllYourActions.html) here, 
but if you really want to look at the source code,
the .tws file is a [Twine](http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) source code file.
